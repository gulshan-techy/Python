# 🚀 Python Mastery Journey: From Scripting to Engineering

> *"There is a difference between 'knowing the syntax' and 'mastering the language'. This directory documents my journey to bridge that gap."*

## 🎯 The Goal
I have used Python for automation and scripting, but now I am hitting the **reset button** to learn it like a Software Engineer. My focus is on writing **clean, optimized, and scalable code** suitable for **DevOps & Cloud environments**.

## 🗺️ The Roadmap & Syllabus

### **Phase 1: Foundations & Internals (The "Why" behind the code)**
- [ ] Memory Management (Stack vs Heap, Garbage Collection)
- [ ] The Python Data Model (Dunder methods)
- [ ] Deep dive into Mutable vs Immutable types
- [ ] Understanding GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)

### **Phase 2: Advanced Logic & Data Structures**
- [ ] List/Dict Comprehensions & Generators (Memory Optimization)
- [ ] Decorators (Function wrapping for Logging/Auth)
- [ ] Context Managers (`with` statement custom implementation)
- [ ] Error Handling best practices (Custom Exceptions)

### **Phase 3: Object-Oriented Python (OOP)**
- [ ] Classes, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
- [ ] SOLID Principles in Python
- [ ] Design Patterns for DevOps (Singleton, Factory)

### **Phase 4: Automation & Engineering (DevOps Focus)**
- [ ] `os` & `sys` modules (File system automation)
- [ ] `subprocess` module (Replacing Bash scripts)
- [ ] `logging` module (Professional logging vs print statements)
- [ ] Writing Unit Tests with `pytest`

### **Phase 5: Cloud & APIs**
- [ ] Consuming REST APIs (`requests` module)
- [ ] AWS SDK for Python (`boto3`)
- [ ] Parse JSON/YAML for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
